### Hi, I'm Benjamin ðŸ‘‹
I am a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Southampton. In my third year, I studied multiple machine learning related courses (Foundations of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing) and worked on human interaction prediction for epidemics as part of my dissertation. In my fourth year, I will continue to study more AI-related courses (Advanced Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning etc...). 

I would like to work at the intersection of software architecture and machine learning research where I would work with researchers and scientists to build novel models and work with engineers to then deploy these models at scale.
