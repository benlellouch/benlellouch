I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Southampton. In my third year, I studied multiple machine learning related courses (Foundations of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing) and worked on human interaction prediction for epidemics as part of my dissertation. I will continue to study more AI-related courses (Advanced Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning etc...) this upcoming year. 

I would like to work at the intersection of software architecture and machine learning research where I would work with researchers and scientists to build novel models and work with engineers to then deploy these models at scale.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- My [personal website](https://github.com/benlellouch/benlellouch.github.io) where I am creating a CMS using [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) 🚀, a Rust web framework. I am planning on learning some React ⚛️ to rework the front-end which is currently a website template.
