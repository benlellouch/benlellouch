I'm an Associate Software Engineer at J.P. Morgan working on FX Trading Systems. 

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- My [personal website](https://github.com/benlellouch/benlellouch.github.io) where I am creating a CMS using [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) 🚀, a Rust web framework. I am planning on learning some React ⚛️ to rework the front-end which is currently a website template.
